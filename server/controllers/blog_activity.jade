    #### Formatting JS via AST
    Deobfuscating minified scripts has been a fun exercise for me. I am trying to take it a step further by leveraging tools like [`esformatter`][] to get rid of minification optimizations (e.g. abuse of commas, upcasting single variable names to recognizable/distinguishable names).

    #### [foundry][]
    Publishing is currently a problem [solved by dotfiles][git-release]. There is no generic solution that has reusable parts between people.

    To fix this, I am building a plugin based library that can publish to multiple repositories (e.g. `npm`, `bower`, `component`, `git tag`, `PyPI`).
