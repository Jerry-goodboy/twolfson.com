    ```js
    reverseMustache({
        template: 'hello {{place}}',
        content: 'hello world'

    #### [foundry][]
    Publishing is currently a problem [solved by dotfiles][git-release]. There is no generic solution that has reusable parts between people.

    To fix this, I am building a plugin based library that can publish to multiple repositories (e.g. `npm`, `bower`, `component`, `git tag`, `PyPI`).
