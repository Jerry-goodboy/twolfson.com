    #### [Foundry][]
    Publishing is currently a problem solved by dotfiles. There is no generic solution that has reusable parts between people.

    Personally, I have been using a fork of [git-extra's `git release`][git-release] script for a while but got fed up with the lack of customization and tests.

    As a result, I am building [foundry][Foundry], a pluggable library that can publish to multiple repositories (e.g. `npm`, `bower`, `component`, `git tag`, `PyPI`).

    #### [Sublime plugin tests][]
    [Sublime Text][] does not have a proper testing framework. With the disparity of Python 2 and 3, it makes cross-version plugins even harder.

    To solve this problem, I am developing a testing framework that can be integrated with [Travis CI][] for full automated tests.
