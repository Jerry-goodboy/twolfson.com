    #### [Sublime plugin tests][]
    [Sublime Text][] does not have a proper testing framework. With the disparity of Python 2 and 3, it makes cross-version plugins even harder.

    To solve this problem, I am developing a testing framework that can be integrated with [Travis CI][] for full automated tests.
