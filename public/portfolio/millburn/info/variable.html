		<blockquote>
				Millburn High School is an outstanding secondary institution that
				offers students a rigorous, stimulating, and diverse academic program
				delivered by an experienced and dedicated faculty. Our students perform
				at an extraordinarily high level while maintaining substantial
				involvement in interscholastic sports, clubs and activities and
				community service. For more than sixteen years, Millburn High School
				has been consistently recognized as one of the 'best' high schools in
				New Jersey by such publications as New Jersey Magazine and Money
				Magazine. Recently, Millburn High School was ranked the number one high
				school in the United States by Jay Matthews, Education Writer for the
				Washington Post, in his book Class Struggle: What's Wrong (And Right)
				With America's Best Public High Schools.
			<br/>
			<br/>
				The program of studies at Millburn High School offers 140 courses
				including 18 Advanced Placement courses, a challenging honors program,
				specialized electives, and unique programs in Special Education,
				Independent Study, Unified Studies, Marketing Education, Life Skills
				and Youth Community Service. The performance of our students in this
				curriculum has been exceptional.
			<br/>
			<br/>
				We are extremely proud of the programs offered by our Special Services
				Department. Instruction in our Resource Room, ESL and BSI classes is
				exemplary. The implementation of in-class support and inclusion
				strategies has enabled us to provide individualized instruction in many
				courses. Currently, curriculum writing in all academic disciplines is
				being reviewed to include core curriculum standards.
			<br/>
			<br/>
				Millburn High School students are also extensively involved in
				extracurricular activities. Approximately 50% of the student body
				participates each season in an athletic program that includes 26
				varsity sports. Bands, orchestras, choruses and specialty vocal and
				instrumental groups boast membership of 325. In addition, students have
				the opportunity to develop leadership potential in such endeavors as
				student publications, dramatic productions, political groups and
				classroom related clubs. Volunteerism is emphasized through school-wide
				service organizations, a peer tutoring program and community related
				projects.
