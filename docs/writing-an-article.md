# Writing an article
Writing an article is simple but we can occasionally forget some steps. Before doing the final release, please check the following:

- Summary is accurate and isn't too long on `/`
- Verify article content has no missing links (i.e. `[text][]` showing)
- Verify article has proper date and order on `/`
