I haven't left any updates about what I mentioned in ["Trying something new"][] since its writing. This has been intentional; I want to minimize life updates on this blog and keep it profesionally oriented (with respect to programming/design).

["Trying something new"]: /2016-02-15-trying-something-new

To address that, I keep the other updates on separate blogs:

- Personal adventures: http://toddisadventuring.tumblr.com/
- Entrepeneur experimentation: https://medium.com/@twolfsn

The tl;dr of those blogs so far is:

I moved to Berlin 1 week ago and am still adjusting. My project is taking longer than expected but moving along; it's on the tail end of prototyping and starting to begin proper development.
