I haven't left any updates about what I mentioned in ["Trying something new"][] since its authoring. This has been intentional; I want to keep life updates on this blog to a minimum and keep it profesionally oriented (with respect to programming/design).

["Trying something new"]: /2016-02-15-trying-something-new

To address that, I keep the other updates on separate blogs:

- Personal adventures: http://toddisadventuring.tumblr.com/
- Entrepeneur experimentation: https://medium.com/@twolfsn
