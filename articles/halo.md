[Halo][Halo] is a client-side MVC framework based on [Addy Osmani's talks][addy-talks] about [Aura][aura]. The goal was to build a modular UI. We did this and took it to a bit of an extreme.

[aura]: https://github.com/aurajs/aura

The end result was so modular that we had a [standalone web page][sandbox] for loading a controller.

If you want to get started using Halo, please visit the [README][Halo]. The remainder of this article will cover what it is good at, bad at, and room for improvement.

# The Good

As already mentioned, Halo is great for modular

# The Bad

Models could be better.

State could use a boost.

# The Future

It's still unclear how far I will be taking Halo. There are always more practical tools to build for the public. However, Halo itself is unique from a lot of other frameworks.

There are a [bunch of open issues][issues] to be taken care of/explored and we just finished up [TodoMVC][todomvc]. I will see you at the summit.
