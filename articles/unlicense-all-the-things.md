The [UNLICENSE][] is a short, sweet, and respectable license (or lack there of).

[UNLICENSE]: http://unlicense.org/

When I started open source, I used the [MIT][] license because that was what everyone else was using. At a glance, the [MIT][] license is short and understandable.

I began to question things after [a talk by Bryan Cantrill on Corporate Open Source][bryan-cantrill]. He dropped terms like [Copyleft][] and explaining why certain licenses are very hostile. I did my research on [MIT][] and found that it was still satisfying my wants.

[Copyleft]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft

Some months later, I come to re-read the [MIT][] license and realize that it is requiring attribution of forks. I am not okay with this.

Following the same principles on [why I began open source][], the software I create should be entirely unrestricted. It belongs to the world, not me.

From this conclusion, I started to look for a license that suited my wants. I stuck around with the [MIT][] license for a few more months but eventually settled.

I narrowed my choices down to the most common public domain licenses:

- [WTFPL][] - Do What The Fuck You Want License, commonly used on [140byt.es][]
- [CC0][] - Creative Commons 0, later on I discovered [gittip][] uses this
- [UNLICENSE][] - The UNLICENSE, my current weapon of choice
