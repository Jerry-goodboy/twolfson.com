The [UNLICENSE][] is a short, sweet, and respectable license (or lack there of).

When I started open source, I used the [MIT][] license because that was what everyone else was using. At a glance, the [MIT][] license is short and understandable.

I began to question things after [a talk by Bryan Cantrill on Corporate Open Source][bryan-cantrill]. He dropped terms like [Copyleft][] and explaining why certain licenses are very hostile. I did my research on [MIT][] and found that it was still satisfying my wants.

[Copyleft]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft

Some months later, I come to re-read the [MIT][] license and realize that it is requiring attribution of forks. I am not okay with this.
