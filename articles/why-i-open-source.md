## Preface
I came to these conclusions during my senior year of college. It was the eventual answer to the question "What do you want to do when you leave college?".

There were a few answers that came to mind "Have fun.", "Be happy.", "Do what I love.", "Make a positive impact on the world." but none felt as good as the conclusion below.

## The answer

I open source because

> I am lucky. I am intelligent and was not born into poverty.
>
> Inheritly, I have a responsibility since I am endowed with this gift.
>
> I am responsible to do what they cannot because they don't have the same opportunities
>
> or priveleges as I do. As a result, I dedicate my free time to making the world a better place.

## Afterword

I don't mean for the above to come off as pretentious. I am being as honest as I can. I apologize if I offended you with what I believe is the truth.
