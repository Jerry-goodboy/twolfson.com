I want to take an article to step back from ourselves and reflect on the wonder and power of tools.

From my experience, tools have made me more efficient by many factors (if not magnitudes).

I covered a lot of tools in ["Develop Faster"][] which encompass tightening developer workflows and still leverage those ideas/most of those tools today.

They has saved me countless hours and reduced potential frustration at tedium.

On top of that, we have tools that makes team collaboration seamless. When working as a remote engineer, it pays off a lot to take the time to do the research. Tools like:

- Trello for making progress visible to everyone while saying nothing
    - My standard board format is "Backlog", "In Progress", "Blocked", "In Review", "Merged", and "Deployed"
- Google Docs/Drive for shared plans, notes, and
- GitHub for shared repositories, code review workflow, and code-specific documentation (e.g. port reservations, folder structure)
- Jenkins/Travis CI for automated code testing to catch lint errors when the developer forgot to run it

Creating things to help us perform higher level tasks more easily is... TODO: Complete sentence

As developers, we are fortunate that our tools are written in the same format as the output we typically generate. There are some professions (e.g. UI/UX designers) which don't have this luxury and thus will need to learn multiple skills to build tools.

If you have never written a tool for yourself before, then I suggest trying it out. The results should include:

- You will start to see your actions in a new light
- You will start thinking of new solutions for problems
- You will have a new tool and as a result be more efficient

If you would like examples of tools, look at my GitHub:

- [File-Watcher][] was my first tool (outside of tools in Math proofs)
- [grunt-spritesmith][] was my first "big project" tool

Unfortunately, I can't tell you what to build because:

- I don't know the problems you are experiencing
- My problems won't motivate you as well as your own problems
