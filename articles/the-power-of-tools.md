I want to take an article to step back from ourselves and reflect on the wonder and power of tools.

From my experience, tools have made me more efficient by many factors (if not magnitudes).

I covered a lot of tools in ["Develop Faster"][] which encompass tightening developer workflows and still leverage those ideas/most of those tools today.

They has saved me countless hours and reduced potential frustration at tedium.

On top of that, we have tools that makes team collaboration seamless. When working as a remote engineer, it pays off a lot to take the time to do the research. Tools like:

- Trello for making progress visible to everyone while saying nothing
    - My standard board format is "Backlog", "In Progress", "Blocked", "In Review", "Merged", and "Deployed"
- Google Docs/Drive for shared plans, notes, and
- GitHub for shared repositories, code review workflow, and code-specific documentation (e.g. port reservations, folder structure)
- Jenkins/Travis CI for automated code testing to catch lint errors when the developer forgot to run it
