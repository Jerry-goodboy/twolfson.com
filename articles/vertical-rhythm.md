On various occasions at my new company, I have been asked to use less comments. This is a funny problem to have; it wasn't that I was abusing comments, it was that the code was in Python and self-descriptive enough.

At that point, I realized that while my code was consistent and well-commented, there wasn't a rhyme or reason to my structure. When I initially started developing in PHP, I began to chunk my code because it "just felt right".
