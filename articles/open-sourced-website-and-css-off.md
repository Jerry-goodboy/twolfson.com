I am finally knocking this off of my TODO list. The first of which are to open source both my website ([available here](https://github.com/twolfson/twolfson.com)) and my entry for the CSS Off ([available here](https://github.com/twolfson/CSS-Off--2011-)).

A hosted version of the CSS off is available on [GitHub](http://twolfson.github.com/CSS-Off--2011-/) and in my [portfolio](http://twolfson.com/public/portfolio/css_off/).
