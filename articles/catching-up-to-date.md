In this post, I would like to sum up all of the contests, scripts I have written, and everything else I meant to write about since my arrival in California (mid-May 2011). So, without further ado here they are:

Scripts
=======
- [CSS Query](https://github.com/Ensighten/CSS-Query) - < 1kb minified script that acts as a shim for querySelectorAll with support for searching within specific nodes.
- [Facebook Auto Subscriber](https://github.com/twolfson/Facebook-Auto-Subscriber) - Bookmarklet that provides a pop-up for batch updating Friend subscriptions.
- [Resource Collector](https://github.com/twolfson/Resource-Collector) and [File Watcher](https://github.com/twolfson/File-Watcher) are two sibling scripts that collect URI's of resources off of the page and watches a set of URI's respectively. When combined, they can be used for hands-free refresh on any platform. I plan to write a blog post on these in the future.
