I am making progress with respect to relative line lengths inside of code.

A few months ago, I had the idea to apply the typographic concept of
ideal characters per line and [begin applying it to code][optimal-lines-v1].

[optimal-lines-v1]: /2013-09-08-optimal-line-length-theory

Unfortunately, the concept was rough around the edges and I struggled at
making it more appealing. A few weeks later, I attempted the approach of

There is a piece that is still missing; as you type code, you magically hit
a limit without any forewarning. I attempted to use a ruler for this but
when you switched lines, it got frustrating to watch it jump around.
