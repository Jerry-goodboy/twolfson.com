I am back from Japan. It was an amazing experience; I met a lot of interesting people, adapted to a new culture, and started learning another language. It is humbling to live in a country that speaks a different langauge. You realize how practical speaking the same language is.

# Experience
## First weeks
My first couple of weeks were rough. Once you leave the train stations, English becomes uncommon. When I was finding my house for the first time, I had trouble with the maps (some had no English, others shifted compass orientation). Once I found my neighborhood, I wasn't certain it was it (no English translation on the signs).

My cell phone wasn't compatible with the mobile bands in Japan and I wound up getting a new phone shipped from my parents. This limited how far I was willing to venture because getting lost can no longer be fixed by Google Maps.

## Adaptation
Eventually, I adjusted, got my phone, and started learning up [Japanese][] (日本ご). I had been studying [hiragana][] and [katakana][] for a month before but my reading speed was very slow. It took about a month and a lot of drills to start reading the characters quickly.

> **Quick lesson:** [Japanese][] has 3 scripts: [hiragana][], [katakana][], and [kanji][]. Japanese has 50 sounds as part of the language (a, i, u, e, o, ka, ki, ku, ke, ko, sa, se, ...). Hiragana and katakana are direct representations of these sounds (i.e. a [syllabary][]) (e.g. `あ, い, う` for `a, i, u`). Hiragana is used to represent native Japanese words and particles (e.g. `りんご` (ri-n-go) is apple, `の` is "of"). Katakana is used to represent words taken from other languages (e.g. `コーヒー` (ko-o-hi-i, sounds like kooh-hee) is coffee, `オレンジ` (o-re-n-ji) is orange). Kanji are pictographs of words (e.g. `人` (ひと, hi-to) is a person; a stick figure's legs). There are 2,000 of these characters in Japanese, each with a different meaning. They are the same as those in Chinese but Chinese has 10,000.

> If you are going to learn Japanese, I strongly encourage learning [katakana][] first as it has the most mileage. [Katakana][katakana] and [kanji][] are common but [hiragana][] is uncommon. For example, alcohol menus are mostly contain katakana (e.g. `ラムコーク` (ra-mu-ko-o-ku, rahmoo koohku) is "rum [and] coke").
