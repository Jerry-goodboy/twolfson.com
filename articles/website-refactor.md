Visual and backend touchups to [twolfson.com][] have been a long time coming. However, over the last couple of weeks, I took the initiative to move to a website I would be proud of.

[twolfson.com]: /

Inside of this refactor:

- Upgraded from `grunt@0.3` to `grunt@0.4`
- Moved from [LESS][] to [SASS][]
- Moved from [Bootstrap][] to [inuit.css][]
- Normalized all CSS classes to [BEM][] classes
- Increased base font size to 18px for typographic readability
- Added activity section to [homepage][]
- Added related articles / projects section to each article
- Re-arranged [routes configuration][]

[LESS]: http://lesscss.org
[SASS]: http://sass-lang.com/
[Bootstrap]: http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/
[inuit.css]: https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css
[BEM]: http://bem.info/
[homepage]: /

The outcome is something I am much more happy to work on and maintain
