This is a partial continuation of my previous catch up post. I finally got my [CSS Off](http://www.unmatchedstyle.com/cssoff/index.php) score; 61/100 points and 66th of 417 place.

I feel like I did really well for myself and am learning plenty from the [top 25 winners](http://www.unmatchedstyle.com/news/cssoff-winners-2012.php). You can find my [demo here](http://twolfson.github.io/CSS-Off--2011-/) and the [initial design here](http://www.unmatchedstyle.com/cssoff/signup.php).
