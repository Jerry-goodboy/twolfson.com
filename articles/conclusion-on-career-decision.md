When I left for Japan, it was to [do some soul searching][break-why]. I wanted to reflect on my life trajectory and try to divine some wisdom for my future. Unfortunately, while the experience was amazing, I came up [unfulfilled in that category][back-life-path].

A couple months ago, I had an epitome and half-awokenly scribbled down some notes. As with some good theories, the answer was obvious. Here's what I wrote down:

> Consider what potential goals you want to achieve. Then, select your career based on those goals.

> For me, it is making a sizable difference in the world. I have chosen software engineer for now.

To extend on that further, my life goal is the same as [why I open source][]: To make the world a better place.

With my experience and knowledge in programming, the largest impact I can have is by sticking to software engineering. That being said, programming is a means to an end and we shouldn't lose sight of that. Knowing other subjects like design can be equally as powerful and so I am trying to further my knowledge there as well.
