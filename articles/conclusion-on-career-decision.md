When I left for Japan, it was to [do some soul searching][break-why]. I wanted to reflect on my life trajectory and try to divine some wisdom for my future. Unfortunately, while the experience was amazing, I came up [empty handed][back-life-path].

A couple months ago, I had an epiphany and half-awokenly scribbled down some notes. As with some good theories, the answer was obvious but it never clicked before. Here's what I wrote down:

> Consider what potential goals you want to achieve. Then, select your career based on those goals.
>
> For me, it is making a sizable difference in the world. I have chosen software engineer for now.

To extend on that further, my life goal is the same as [why I open source][]: To make the world a better place.

With my experience and knowledge in programming, the largest impact I can have is by sticking to software engineering. That being said, programming is a means to an end and we shouldn't lose sight of that.

Other subjects like design can be equally as powerful and we should always be considering the end result of our work as the main focus. Although, a note to programmers, this should include the maintenance of said work as well.
