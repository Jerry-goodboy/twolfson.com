Introducing [jojo](http://twolfson.github.com/jojo/), the 10 second blog-engine for hackers (in javascript). Jojo is heavily based on and insprired by [toto](https://github.com/cloudhead/toto), the 10 second blog-engine for hackers, which was originally written in ruby.

The reason for my rewrite of toto was to integrate it into my current web server and it does just that; you are looking at the first server to use jojo.
