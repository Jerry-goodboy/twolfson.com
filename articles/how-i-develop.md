}

I want to share how I work and the tools I use so that others can learn from my workflow, for better or for worse.

# Starting a repo
I follow the open source first methodology when it comes to projects. This means from the very first commit,

TODO: git init, hub create, grunt-init

# Developing on a repo
TODO: grunt, nodemon, livereload, tiny-lr, listen-spawn, controlpad/spectacles/windowpad

TODO: SideBarEnhancements, QuickFileCreator, Find++

# Publishing updates
TODO: git-release, dotfiles

# Maintaining repos
TODO: Tests (code and perceptual)

# Excess information

My laptop is a Lenovo W520.

My operating system is Linux Mint 14.

My browser of choice is Firefox with Firebug as my development tools.

For the recordings in this post I used [rprichard's x11-canvas-screencast][x11-screencast].
