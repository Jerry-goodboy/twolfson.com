I have quit Underdog.io and am trying something new; I am experimenting with starting a business.

# Why?
After working remote for over 1 year, I have concluded that I prefer in-office work environments. I miss conversations about the business and code that occur organically (e.g. talking about ideas over lunch).

Unfortunately, Underdog.io headquarters is in NYC and I am strongly opposed to living in NYC. As a result, sometime in the next year I am going to be switching companies.

# Plans
This summer, I plan on leaving Chicago and moving to Berlin for a few months (unrelated to Underdog.io).

Instead of waiting until I leave Chicago or leave Berlin to depart from Underdog.io, I have decided to accelerate the termination to now.

In the time gap between now and the end of Chicago, I want to pursue some ideas I have had for companies.

Compared to a city like New York City or San Francisco, rent is much cheaper in Chicago. As a result, experimenting with ideas here will have a much lower burn rate and corresponding lower risk for me financially.

# Execution
I will be building my first product solo. I believe that I have enough experience in software engineering that I should be able to design, build, and ship a product.

Everything else that I should know (e.g. marketing, legal knowledge), I will pick up as I go.

# Keeping myself in check
I have heard many stories of people delaying their launches indefinitely or getting stuck with a mediocre product. I don't want to get caught in that trap.

By constraining myself to my departure date (ironically still to be determined), I should prevent any undesirable overattachment/loss aversion.

# What are you building?
Currently the project is under wraps but I will release information when I feel more confident with the result.
