I have quit Underdog.io and am trying something new; I am experimenting with starting a business.

# Why?
My current life goal is to make the world a better place. I have been fulfilling that goal via my past jobs but want to explore building some of my own ideas as well.

# How?
I believe that I have enough experience in software engineering that I should be able to design, build, and ship a product. Everything else that I should know (e.g. marketing, legal knowledge) I will pick up as I go.

# Experimentation
I am considering this more of an experiment than a full-fledge endeavor. I plan to leave Chicago and move to Berlin for a few months in the summer (e.g. leave in May).

I have heard many stories of people delaying their launches indefinitely or getting stuck with a mediocre product. I don't want to get caught in that trap. As a result, I am constraining myself to launch the product by my departure date (ironically still to be determined).

# What are you building?
Stealth mooooode
