I am taking a break from everything and moving to Japan for 3 months.

# What?
I have quit Uber and in a more general sense, web development. I will be living in Japan as a tourist from July 17th to October 13th.

# Why?
Before we can I never chose web development as my career path, it happened to be the best choice when I graduated college. I started when I was in high school and continued doing freelance while in college. In college, I was a Math and Chemistry major. But, I wound up hating Chemistry and there are no jobs in Math except for academia.

I have achieved a level of comfort in web development. I feel that it is time to step out of my comfort zone, look back on what I have been doing. I want to clear my head from work, think about what I would like to achieve, and decide whether to continue with web development or start doing something else.

# What about X?
I am putting everything into a minimal state before I leave.

- Car? Storage
- Apartment? Terminating lease
- Open source? Maintenance only, no new features

# What are your plans in Japan?
I will be staying in a foreigner house in Ebisu but beyond that, I don't have any plans.

I want to explore Japan and learn about another culture. I want to reflect on my philosphies, question my morals, and experiment with new ideas.
