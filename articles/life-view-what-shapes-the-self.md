I believe that people are shaped based on the circumstances they are born into and the experiences they encounter.

If we assume that everyone is born with a pre-existing personality and thought process, then no conclusions can be drawn as the initial state is random.

As a result, we assume everyone is born as a clean slate.

The first environment they encounter will have the largest impact on their life. The environment invokes experiences (e.g. warm, bright) as well as the people inside of it (e.g. nurture).

The earlier an experience occurs, the larger the impact is has on the self; the self hardens over time.

For example, if you have a stressful memory-recall related experience early on, then it might affect your ability to store certain information. However, if you have the same experience in adulthood, it might not do anything at all.

For pre-dispositions (e.g. genetic), the iteraction with these dispositions should be recognized as experiences themself. For example, sensitivity to light would not affect someone until they first iteract with light.
