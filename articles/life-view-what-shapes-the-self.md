I believe that people are shaped based on the circumstances they are born into and the experiences they encounter.

Under the assumption that everyone is born as a clean slate. They must react to this environment which has an impact on the self, making it think and reason about the experience it has encountered.

For pre-dispositions (e.g. genetic), the iteraction with these dispositions should be recognized as experiences themself. For example, sensitivity to light would not affect someone until they first iteract with light.
