As a developer, knowing design basics has some benefits:

- Better communication with designers due to having shared knowledge
- Better architecture for HTML/CSS
    - It's hard to build a system without knowing its root principles
- Can provide targeted feedback about designs and propose other ideas

# What is design?
Design is a broad categorization of many topics, similar to how the layperson's concept of "programming" encompasses writing Assembly to writing CSS to managing networks.

Here are some instances of design:

- Visual/graphic design, to create visual assets such as logos, posters, and advertisements
    - Examples: [Behance][], [Dribbble][]
- User Interaction/User Experience (UI/UX) design, to plan out an application's pages and workflows
    - Examples: [Google][], [Uber][]
- Industrial design, to create, plan, and prototype physical objects
    - Examples: [Herman Miller][], [MUJI][]

We will be focusing on UI/UX design as this has the most crossover with developer work.

Before we get started, I want to give you the proper mindset. There is a common phrase in design:

> When there is good design, you will never notice it.

This means good design helps the user achieve their goals with as little friction as possible and in an intuitive manner. Good design doesn't need tour guides -- the interactions are obvious.

# Grids
- Sometimes known as typographic grids
- Widths and gutters

# Baselines and vertical rhythm
- Would be nice to allow `?grid` access

# Typography
- Hierarchy
- Serif vs sans serif
- Why a type face matter (branding, communication)

# Design patterns
- Visual components (e.g. jQuery plugin, React view, Angular view, web component, Backbone view)

# Content weight
- What we percieve as visual center might not be right

# For developers
- CSS framework vs UI toolkit
    - Elaborate on Bootstrap/Foundation vs Inuit.css
    - Talk about others like Suit
    - Talk about Bourbon, Bitters, and Compass
- OOCSS
