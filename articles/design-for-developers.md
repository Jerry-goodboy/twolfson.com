When I joined my first full time job and saw a redesign first hand, I became super curious about what this magic process of making a site better was.

Prior to that point, I always thought of design as something that "artsy people were good at". But the answers are more subtle than that. Design breaks down a lot more -- visual design, UI/UX design, industrial design.

I am going to be focusing on UI/UX design since it (1) requires no artistic abilities to employ and (2) by building up knowledge here, it will yield the greatest impact and (3) I have no knowledge of visual design and industrial design.

Topics to cover:

Grids
- Sometimes known as typographic grids
- Widths and gutters

Baselines and vertical rhythm
- Would be nice to allow `?grid` access

Typography
- Hierarchy
- Serif vs sans serif
- Why a type face matter (branding, communication)

Content weight
- What we percieve as visual center might not be right

For developers:
- CSS framework vs UI toolkit
    - Elaborate on Bootstrap/Foundation vs Inuit.css
    - Talk about others like Suit
    - Talk about Bourbon, Bitters, and Compass
