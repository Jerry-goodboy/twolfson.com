Remembering is a practical skill. It's how we live our daily routines; brushing our teeth, showering, going to work. On the opposite site, there is forgetting which happens for most people by accident or unintentionally. In my daily life, I have a few techniques to help me forget things to:

- Allow myself to think about other topics
- Relieve mental stress
- Assist with remembering longer term items that are not immediately required

# Remembering when falling asleep
When falling asleep, paper note book

# Splitting mental space for personal and work
Thinking about work tasks while you are in your personal life can be unnecessarily stressful. I try my best to keep personal things personal and work things work.

When working:

- Avoid checking personal email as it will remind you of stressing other tasks that you have in your daily life

Working in an office is a great way to spatially separate work and personal

When working remotely, never directly context switch between work and personal tasks. Always do something between them. For me, I sleep my computer and go get dinner or take a walk.

Vice versa for personal:
- Avoid checking work email as it will remind you of stressing other tasks that you have in your daily life

// TODO: Is this good advice?

- Push notifications for email are a really bad habit and will cause unnecessary stress

# Juggling mental notes
We can only balance about 5 different notes to ourselves at a given time. Anything more and the whole thing falls to shit.

This plays back into when falling asleep, start to think about more on a task and forget where we came from

Similarly, if we need 10 items when we go grocery shopping and don't write a list, we will probably forget 1 or 2 things because they weren't on our expected route

# Mental foresight
When in Japan, could read code but couldn't think of names nearly as easily.
