Remembering is a practical skill. It's part of our daily routines; remembering a grocery list, remembering to ship a package, remembering to ask your friend about that recent event.

The opposite or remembering is forgetting. For the purpose of our discussion, I want to consider controlled forgetting as a practical skill. When we forget something, it is released from our cognitive load and makes space for something new. For example:

- Allow thinking about other topics (e.g. reflecting on past events)
- Relieve mental stress (e.g. juggling thoughts)
- Allow ourselves to offload a thought until we actually need it (e.g. setting a calendar reminder)

I should state that:

- This is all based off of personal experience with no rigid science
- While it might sound like we are discussing unlearning, we are not. Unlearning means removing something entirely from your memory. Forgetting means it is placed into a deeper, not constantly active part of our memory

# Remembering when falling asleep
When falling asleep, paper note book

# Splitting mental space for personal and work
Thinking about work tasks while you are in your personal life can be unnecessarily stressful. I try my best to keep personal things personal and work things work.

When working:

- Avoid checking personal email as it will remind you of stressing other tasks that you have in your daily life

Working in an office is a great way to spatially separate work and personal

When working remotely, never directly context switch between work and personal tasks. Always do something between them. For me, I sleep my computer and go get dinner or take a walk.

Vice versa for personal:
- Avoid checking work email as it will remind you of stressing other tasks that you have in your daily life

// TODO: Is this good advice?

- Push notifications for email are a really bad habit and will cause unnecessary stress

# Juggling mental notes
We can only balance about 5 different notes to ourselves at a given time. Anything more and the whole thing falls to shit.

This plays back into when falling asleep, start to think about more on a task and forget where we came from

Similarly, if we need 10 items when we go grocery shopping and don't write a list, we will probably forget 1 or 2 things because they weren't on our expected route

# Mental foresight
When in Japan, could read code but couldn't think of names nearly as easily.
