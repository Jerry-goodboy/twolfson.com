}

When designing my business card, I had an epiphane about when to use filled icons vs when to use hollow icons.

- If the design is content dense, then we should use a filled icon
- If the design is content light, then we should use a hollow icon
- If it's in between, then either should work but the icons should be consistently filled or hollow
- Hollow icons should have consistent stroke width

I'm uncertain if this is a hard and fast rule. In programming, the answer is almost always "it depends" and there are rarely simple problems.

But let's look at some examples:

# Examples
## Dense content
**Filled icons (better):**

**Hollow icons (worse):**

## Light content
**Hollow icons (better):**

**Filled icons (worse):**

## Hollow icon stroke width
**Same stroke width (better):**

**Different stroke width (worse):**
