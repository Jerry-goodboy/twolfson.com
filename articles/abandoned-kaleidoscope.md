Back in November 2012, I began working on a project titled [kaleidoscope][]. The idea was a script that would take screenshots of multiple webpages in the browser and display them in a grid on a website. Each image would automatically refresh as any file it used was updated and it would be entirely standalone within the browser.

The reason for this was updating one line of CSS verifying isolated changes for a single page which requires checking multiple webpages.
