**Warning: This article is more opinionated than previous ones.**

As with everyone, I have began to develop opinions on certain styles of code; some concious and practical, others gutteral and more difficult to explain.

Below is a list of those that fall into the latter category but I have squeezed logic out of.

As a reminder, anti-patterns are not things that should be avoided at all costs; they have their place in quick and simple code. However, for maintainable and future-proof reasons, it is better to avoid them.
