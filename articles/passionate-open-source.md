Staying active in open source is a problem I see every now and then.

- Proactive: contributing to a repository for the sake of doing open source is going to burn you out
- Don't solve a problem for the sake of using a new code technique. I mean you can but that shouldn't be the main driving factor
- B e sure to not conflate author activity with project activity. I maintain a lot of different projects, I can't take time to rewrite all of them and add in unnecessary
- Keep things focused -- one thing well, not bloatware
- Don't lie to yourself, open source will take time. People will report bugs, people will report features that do belong in your project, so make sure that you will have time for it. @indexzero once said that open source something to the extent to that open source is similar to taking care of a child. My interpretation of that would be, it's not nearly as bad since it's not a 100% time job. However, bug reports will pop up at your least convenient moment and feature requests will pop up right before you were going to work on that brand new project. Learn to handle these issues quickly and efficiently via tools like tests, friendly debugging errors, and developer friendly documentation (e.g. lots of examples).
