Staying active in open source is a problem I see every now and then. It's usually manifested by a once active repo now overwhelmed by issues and pull requests.



- Proactive: contributing to a repository for the sake of doing open source is going to burn you out
- Don't solve a problem for the sake of using a new code technique. I mean you can but that shouldn't be the main driving factor
- B e sure to not conflate author activity with project activity. I maintain a lot of different projects, I can't take time to rewrite all of them and add in unnecessary
- Keep things focused -- one thing well, not bloatware
- Don't lie to yourself, open source will take time. People will report bugs, people will report features that do belong in your project, so make sure that you will have time for it. @indexzero once said that open source something to the extent to that open source is similar to taking care of a child. My interpretation of that would be, it's not nearly as bad since it's not a 100% time job. However, bug reports will pop up at your least convenient moment and feature requests will pop up right before you were going to work on that brand new project. Learn to handle these issues quickly and efficiently via tools like tests, friendly debugging errors, and developer friendly documentation (e.g. lots of examples).
- Mention about taking on collaborators
- Never force yourself to do anything you don't want to do. Instead, communicate how you feel (e.g. overwhelmed with other tasks at the moment, won't be able to take a look for 2 weeks [this is usually buffered by 1.5x]. Maybe the user will empathize.
- Set expectations quickly and always reply within a timely manner
    - You are the front line of support for your project
    - You know when you will be fre
- Empathy is frustrating but necessary
    - Is someone asking for a "stupid" feature? Before immediately closing that issue and making them feel like shit. Take a moment to continue to the thread asking them "Why do you want that feature?"
    - Don't insult them or demean them by saying "Why do you want that feature when feature X exists?" You are making assumptions about their setup. Sometimes you get surprised by their setup. One example from personal experience:
        -  I maintain [spritesmith][TODO: link] which was built as a tool for automatically building CSS sprites. One day, I got an issue about disabling sorting. My initial reaction was "Why would you want that?" but as it turned out, the user was using it for animation sprites. As a result, we built a feature to disable sorting of sprites.
            - TODO: Find issue and link to it
