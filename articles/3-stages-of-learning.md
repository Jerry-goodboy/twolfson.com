A long while ago, [a professor][Professor Dix] enlightened my class with the 3 stages of learning. At that point and since then, I have found them to ring true time and time again. Without further ado, here they are:

1. Duplication - The ability to take content and repeat it back
2. Comprehension - The ability to take content, understand it, and state it in another way
3. Improvisation - The ability to take content and create new conclusions from it
