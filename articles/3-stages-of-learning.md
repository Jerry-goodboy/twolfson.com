A long while ago, [a professor][Professor Dix] enlightened my class with his theory on the 3 stages of learning. At that point and since then, it has held true time and time again. Without further ado, here are the stages:

1. Duplication - Ability to take content and repeat it back
2. Comprehension - Ability to take content, understand it, and state it in another way
3. Improvisation - Ability to take content and create new conclusions from it

# Examples
## Learning Chemistry
For the example where this originated, here are some examples of each stage:

1. Duplication
    - Reading content from a textbook and reciting it back
    - Taking notes in class and repeating them back
2. Comprehension
    - Taking notes in class and rephrasing them in your own words
    - Asking deeper questions about content
3. Improvisation
    - Deriving new formulas
    - Creating new conclusions

## Learning Math
Learning Math is very similar to learning Chemistry. Some more concrete examples of improvisation would be:

- Breaking down proofs into smaller sections for easier reuse
- Creating a new proof based off the combination of other proofs

## Learning Programming
For learning Programming, some examples of each stage would be:

1. Duplication
    - Taking an existing program and rewriting it line for line
    - Writing a program that follows a specification
2. Comprehension
    - Taking an existing program and swapping variable values
    - Explaining why choices were made in a specification
3. Improvisation
    - Rewriting a program but maintaining the same results
        - For example, moving from iterative to recursive
    - Create a new specification for a problem
