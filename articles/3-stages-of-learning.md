A long while ago, [a professor][Professor Dix] enlightened my class with the 3 stages of learning. At that point and since then, they have held true time and time again. Without further ado, here they are:

1. Duplication - The ability to take content and repeat it back
2. Comprehension - The ability to take content, understand it, and state it in another way
3. Improvisation - The ability to take content and create new conclusions from it

# Examples
## Learning Chemistry
For the example where this originated, here are some examples of each stage:

1. Duplication
    - Reading content from a textbook and repeating it back
    - Taking notes in class and repeating them back
2. Comprehension
    - Taking notes in class and rephrasing them in your own words
    - Asking deeper questions about content
3. Improvisation
    - Deriving new formulas
    - Creating new conclusions

## Learning Math
Learning Math is very similar to learning Chemistry. Some more concrete examples of improvisation would be:

- Breaking down proofs into smaller sections for easier reuse
- Creating a new proof based off the combination of other proofs

## Learning Programming
For learning Programming, some examples of each stage would be:

1. Duplication
    - Taking an existing program and writing it line for line
    - Rewriting out the steps for an algorithm
2. Comprehension
    - Taking an existing program and swapping variable values
3. Improvisation
    - Rewriting a program but maintaining the same results
