Dear [gruntjs][gruntjs],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following letter is about my thoughts and complaints of the recent upgrade from `0.3` to `0.4`. Normally, I am enthusiastic about progression in the development world but this causes me much anger and frustration.

# Introductions

My name is Todd Wolfson, I am [open source enthusiast][projects] who is a [**huge fan** of `grunt`][grunt-repos] in its current `0.3` form.

I have a lot of respect for the work you have done on `grunt` and the collaboration it has caused for among the JavaScript community.

However, I feel that the proposed changes are a step in the wrong direction; undoing tons of man-hours not just in `grunt plugins`, but in every project that relies on `grunt` ([at least 5k if stargazers holds true][grunt-stars]).

# Complaints

## Changing interface without backwards compatibility
This honestly shocked me when I first heard about this. In fact, it shocked me so much that I was in denial until the date of writing this.
